Todo Summary Assistant
A full-stack application to manage your personal to-do list, generate meaningful summaries using a Large Language Model (LLM), and send those summaries directly to a Slack channel.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React

Backend: Node.js with Express (Java Spring Boot alternative available)

Database: Supabase PostgreSQL (or Firebase Firestore)

LLM API: OpenAI (GPT-4 / GPT-3.5)

Slack Integration: Slack Incoming Webhooks

Hosting: Netlify (Frontend), Heroku/Render/Custom Server (Backend)

Features
Add, edit, delete, and mark to-do tasks as complete.

Generate natural language summaries of pending tasks using an LLM.

Automatically post generated summaries to a Slack channel using Incoming Webhooks.

Getting Started
Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/A1Kumari/Todo-Summary-Assistant-.git
cd todo-summary-assistant
Backend Setup
Create a .env file in the backend folder and configure the environment variables:

env
Copy code
# Port for backend server
PORT=4000

# Database URL (Supabase PostgreSQL or MongoDB URI)
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/Todo

# JWT secret for authentication (if used)
JWT_SECRET="4cU7z!gP$e@V1wLz^Dq8KsXr#Nm2TzMb"

# OpenAI or Cohere API key for LLM integration
LLM_API_KEY=your_llm_api_key

# Slack Incoming Webhook URL
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url
Available Scripts (Frontend)
In the project directory (frontend), run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page reloads on changes.

LLM Integration
This project integrates a real LLM API (OpenAI GPT or Cohere) to generate summaries.

Setup
Sign up for an API key at OpenAI or Cohere.

Add your API key to the backend .env file as LLM_API_KEY.

The backend sends the list of pending todos to the LLM API and receives a natural language summary.

The summary is then forwarded to Slack via the configured webhook URL.

Slack Integration
Slack Incoming Webhooks allow posting messages from external apps into Slack channels.

Setup
Create a Slack Incoming Webhook in your workspace via Slack API Webhooks.

Choose the Slack channel where you want the summaries posted.

Copy the generated webhook URL.

Add it to your backend .env as SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL.

API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/todos	Fetch all to-do items
POST	/todos	Add a new to-do item
DELETE	/todos/:id	Delete a to-do item by ID
PUT	/todos/:id	Edit a to-do item
PUT	/todos/:id/complete	Mark a task as complete
POST	/summarize	Generate summary of pending todos & send to Slack

Project Structure
bash
Copy code
/frontend      # React application source code
/backend      # Node.js Express server code
/database     # Supabase or MongoDB configuration files (if any)
/.env         # Environment variables for backend
Deployment
Frontend: Deploy on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

Backend: Host on Heroku, Render, or any custom server environment.

Ensure environment variables (LLM_API_KEY, SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, MONGO_URI) are properly configured in your deployment environment.
